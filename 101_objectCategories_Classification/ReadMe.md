Classifying the Caltech-101 Dataset from a pre-trained CNN model.
The used model is the VGG-16.
I have made the layers of VGG untrainable and only the last Dense layer is trained for some epochs.
I have worked this in Google Collab under 12 GB of GPU.

The dataset is available in the .py file at the top.
It imports the dataset from my GitHub directory.
