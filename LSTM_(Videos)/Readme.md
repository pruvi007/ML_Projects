Dataset - KTH dataset (499 videos of human performing 6 actions)
Need to classify the videos with thei corresponding actions. 
Since the video has temporal information, so LSTM's are preferred over traditional Neural Network Models.
Contains various models that are able to predict the actions with high accuracies and less time complexity.
